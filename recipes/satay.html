        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk togethe brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, onion, oil, soy sauce, coriander, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Bruise lemon grass by hittingit lightly several times with the back of a large chef's knife; mince lemongrass and add to marinade.</li>
            <li>Cut beef sirloin into strips about 2 1/2-inches long and 1/8 inch-thick. Stir beef into
marinade until beef is completely coated, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic
wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from marinade and shake off excess marinade. Thread 1/4 of the meat
                onto each metal skewer. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the preheated grill; cook until meat stops sticking to the grill, 1 to 2
                    minutes. Flip skewers and continue cooking until meat is well browned and shows grill
                    marks, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Flip skewers once more; cook until meat is still slightly pink,
                    about 2 minutes. Transfer skewers to a platter; let rest for 2 minutes before serving.</li>
