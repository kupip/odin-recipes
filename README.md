My Odin Recipe Project

So this is a project to demonstrate my ability to utilize HTML. This include the use of img, paragraph, unordered an ordered lists, and links. And also, with the added css files, it demonstrates my ability to incorporate css with the HTML file.

Any suggestion is welcome, thank you.
